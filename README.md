# Project: Portfolio

This repo contains the project listed as the header above for the
[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/)
[Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The mock up shown
[here](design-mockup-portfolio.pdf)
is implemented with the files below and use my own pictures:

 * [html](card.html)
 * [css](styles.css)

At present the pictures are placeholders.
Once I get featured portfolio work the image will be changed to ones
that are more representative of the featured portfolio work.
